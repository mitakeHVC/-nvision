# Project Title: Data Schema and Transformation Implementation

This project aims to implement the data schemas, relationships, and transformation logic outlined in the `data_schema_and_transformation_proposal.md` document.

## Current Status

- **E-commerce (EC) Data Models:** Python Pydantic models for the EC system entities (Customers, Products, Categories, Orders, OrderItems, Suppliers, CustomerReviews) have been created and are located in `src/data_models/ec_models.py`. These models include basic data validation.

## Next Steps

The project will proceed with:
- Development of data models for CRM and Shared/Support systems.
- Implementation of Neo4j graph schema and data ingestion logic.
- Implementation of ChromaDB vector embedding strategies and data ingestion logic.
